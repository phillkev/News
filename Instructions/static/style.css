/* Setting up the base body and used font types.  Throughout this css file you will see I used a mix of
px, em and vw for element sizes.  I found it was best to use vw for fonts its screen based scaling was excellent.
For a few items I stuck with px, specifically border widths really did better with px.  In most cases I found
px to be best for Borders.  the em scaling was intersting and I want to do more research on how it is different 
from vw but functionally it behaved like a cross between px and vw so I did use it in a few places where I needed
less extreme scaling */
